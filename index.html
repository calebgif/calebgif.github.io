<h3>About:</h3>
<p>
    Pointforming is a 3D platforming game where you have to navigate in a near complete darkness environment.
    Use your scanner to "paint" the world around you and navigate from checkpoint to checkpoint. Find collectibles
    along the way to increase your scanner strength and width.

<h3>My Contributions:</h3>
<p>
    For this project, I completed everything solo. I implemented the player movement, "drawing" ability,
    level design, particle system, sound effects, menus, and background music.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
<p>This project was created in Unity and coded in C#. This was my second major Unity project experience. I used
    Atlassian's Jira software for project management, and I specifically made use of their burndown charts to guage how
    well I was on track. I also used Paint3D to create all the textures in Pointforming.
</p>

<h3>Research Performed:</h3>
<p>
    In developing this game, I researched several other 2D and 3D platformers to better understand common mechanics in
    platformers, as well as a general idea of what has been done already. Also, I initially researched if it was
    possible for me to create the "drawing" effect in Unity, which I quickly learned was yes, with a fair bit of math.

<h2>Metroid NES Unity Remaster</h2>

<a href="/metroid-nes-recreation/index.html">Web Build</a>

<h3>About:</h3>
<p>This is a remaster of the first area in the original <em>Metroid</em> game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
    It also includes a custom level which features five new rooms and multiple mechanics centered around using a
    trampoline power-up.</p>

&nbsp;

<h3>My Contributions:</h3>
<p>Work was done in collaboration with <a href=" https://jgettig.github.io/">Jacob Gettig</a>.</p>
<p>I implemented a large majority of the player, including movement, inventory, animation, and weapons. I also
    implemented nearly all audio, and I implemented all collectibles.
    For the custom mechanic, I implemented the horizontal custom rooms, as well as the trampoline bullet and logic
    to spawn a trampoline after expiring.

<h3>Technology/Tools Used:</h3>
<p>This project created in Unity and coded in C#. This was our first major Unity project experience. We used
    Atlassian's Jira software for project management, and specifically made use of their burndown charts to guage how
    well we were avoiding burnout. We also used various other tools, such as GitHub for version control, Photoshop and
    Paint3D for spritesheet editing.
</p>

<h3>Research Performed:</h3>
<p>In completing this <em>Metroid</em> recreation, my partner and I used an online NES emulator, a real NES, and
    youtube videos of NES <em>Metroid</em> to get all of the features as authentic
    as possible. We also researched other NES games and compared them to <em>Metroid</em> to better understand the
    mechanics of <em>Metroid</em> compared to other games of its time.
